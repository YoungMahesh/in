## Shorten your url

- when you want to share a url about facebook-post or twitter-post or news-post, etc, generally the url you are providing is very large.
- Large URLs looks ugly compared to short urls.
- So, if you want some URL to post on your website, or want send it to someone special, shorten them first.
- Websites you shortned on this website, lives here permanantly, short-custom-url once used would never again be used for another site, so you don't need to worry about wrong redirection of link in future.


## System-Design

- NextJS/ReactJS is used as frontend for the site
- NodeJS is used as backend
- [faunadb](https://fauna.com/) is used as a database for storage of custom-urls and their long-urls
